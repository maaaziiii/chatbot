Features
Generates a random starting price between $50 and $100.
Allows users to accept, reject, or propose a counteroffer.
Negotiates within a predefined discount range.
Provides informative responses based on user input.
Usage
Save the code as a Python file (e.g., negotiation_bot.py).

Example Interaction:

Welcome! The initial price for the product is $72. What do you think? (Type 'accept', 'reject', or propose a 'counteroffer')
You: counteroffer 65
Bot: That's a bit high for us. How about we meet at $67 instead?
You: accept
Bot: Great! The deal is closed at $67.
